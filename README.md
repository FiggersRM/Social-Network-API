# Social-Network-API

## Description

In this week, we were asked to use MongoDB and Mongoose to create the server for a social network. We were tasked with creating a database to store users as well as their "thoughts". Both of these have subdocuments in MongoDB: the users have an array of their thoughts as subdocuments, and the thoughts have an array of reactions/comments as a subdocument. In addition to initializing the database, we were also asked to create routes and functions to create, read, update, and delete data as necessary. This was for users, thoughts, as well as reactions. Although there is no front-end for this application, it could easily be applied to create the basis of a social media website.

## Installation

Uses the mongoose, express, and dayjs npm packages

## Usage

This application can currently be used to create users, as well as thoughts for that user. In addition, thoughts can be reacted to by different users. This usage could easily be applied to the front-end of an application to create a social media website. In order to create data for the database, Insomnia can be used.
